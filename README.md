# GraphQL server

This is a GraphQL server implemented with Prisma ORM, connecting to a Postgres database.

## 👨🏼‍💻 Things implemented

- Authentication built with a signed jwt and a user hierachy with levels of permissions.
- Authentication queries (signUp, login)
- Authorized queries (CreateTask, ModifyTask, DeleteTask, allUsers, authGetTasks)
- GraphQL subscription (a websocket) for knowing which action was performed by which user.

### ▶️ Run this project

- Run "npm install"
- Run "npm run dev"
- Start making queries from your app or visit "http://localhost:port" from your machine.
